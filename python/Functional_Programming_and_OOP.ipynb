You should recognize that Python is generally considered an \"object-oriented programming\" (OOP) language. Even though this is its primary paradigm, Python is also able to support another paradigm, known as \"functional programming.\" We will explore these different approaches below, and we will use both seamlessly in our code throughout the course."

Oftentimes, but not always, a function takes an \"input\" (also known as the \"argument(s)\") and \"returns\" something. A function performs its task when it is \"called\". You \"call\" a function by placing parentheses at the end of its name.\n",

You then explored one type of object (strings) and a few methods associated with string objects. You had the chance to learn the key terminology associated with both paradigms (functions and objects). While this is just an overview, you also practiced some essential syntax such as when to use a dot, parenthesis, or quotation marks. Continue to pay attention to these special characters and their use as seemingly minor syntax differences can cause errors if you do not implement them correctly."
